Published and presented research as first author at the 2023 IEEE MIT Undergraduate Research Technology Conference (URTC).
Trained state-of-the-art CNN models (Resnet 50, VGG16, VGG19) to classify exercise images and developed an automated fitness recommendation platform.
Normalized and preprocessed 13,900 images from the Workout/Exercise Image dataset on Kaggle, achieving best performance with the Resnet 50 model (98.7% accuracy).
